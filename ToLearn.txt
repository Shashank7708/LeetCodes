When working with collections, in C#, the most efficient method is to use the SequencesEqual method, especially if you aren't working with huge datasets or custom comparison rules. It is the most elegant option that keeps your code simple, as it checks for all aspects of the collections (size, order, and element equality) without the need for code that overcomplicates the program. If you are working with arrays, List, or any other IEnumerable collections, you really should use this method as it is the best option in the code skeptics perspective as well.
